Experience

### **Cofounder, EventRay** (2016-present; remote) [4y, 2m]

Event registration SaaS with a goal of being the most powerful, flexible platform available. In 2019 we launched 69 events, registered 27k attendees, and processed $16M in transactions.

- Wrote over 90k lines of backend code, 84k lines of unit, integration, and functional tests.
- Fully featured registration platform, including a logic builder, an eventing system, payments, refunds, fully customizable reporting, transactional emails, a public API, web hooks, and more!
- Rules can be performed against all pieces of data collected by the system (user agent, country of origin, total owed, number of guests, as well as any responses entered by the attendee).
- Forms are completely dynamic (all pages and items on pages are user configurable). Logic can often create very complex cascades of actions. A task executor processes all of them before committing the results to a database, to ensure that no rules were violated.
- Payment services integrated with include: paypal, payflow pro, authorize.net, and stripe
- Integration points include API, webhook at the page or form level, saml, or spreadsheet upload
- Reports can be built using the same type of expressions as the rules, providing ultimate flexibility. Reports are compiled down to database expressions.
